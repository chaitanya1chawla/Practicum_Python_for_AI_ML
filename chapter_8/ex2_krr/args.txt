1 Change GridSearchCV to RandomizedSearchCV to get the argument values nearer to the optimum.

2 Data preprocessing (the function is symmetrical on the y-Axis (x==0))
-> flip data (y-axis) to double input size for ML model
-> Other data preprocessing steps would be possible: e.g. add noise to further increase input size

3 The function is known:
-> this enables
    data enhancement(e.g. remove outliers)
    new data creation (random data points on function curve w/o noise)

4 Limitations
    (1) This does not guarantee to get the best results, however, a wider range of variables can be faster tested.
    (2) The assumption for a symmetrical target function must be true (but can be checked in the noisy dataset without knowing the target function)
    (3) Only works if the target function is known, which makes a fitting to noisy data points unnecessary.
